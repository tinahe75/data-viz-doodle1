## Data viz doodle ðŸŽ¨

- This is a data viz dashboard I made for fun, using my own personal data collected in 2024. It's a tiny dataset, but one I often think about. I wanted to play around with the data and visualize the patterns in my purchasing behaviour.

- Preprocessing and EDA were done via Colab + Plotly + Pandas + Python.
