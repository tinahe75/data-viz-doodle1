## Data viz doodle ðŸŽ¨

- This is a data viz dashboard I made for fun, using my own personal data collected in 2024. It's a tiny dataset, but one I often think about. I wanted to play around with the data and visualize the patterns in my purchasing behaviour.

- Preprocessing and EDA are done via Colab + Plotly + Pandas + Python. Figures are exported as HTML files and embedded in the dashboard.

### TODO:

- [x] include Colab notebook
- [x] add highlighting for active buttons
- [ ] add transition when switching between figures
